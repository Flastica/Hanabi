        Nice! Adam played his first card from the hint you gave him.

        Jane also gave you a {vignette("color", IColor.RED)} hint on 2 cards. It might mean those cards are interesting
        to play right now.

        Adam know that his 3rd card is blue. Maybe that if you hint Jane about her {card(IColor.BLUE, 3)} and she plays

        Things are progressing nicely, you already played 8 cards. However your team is running low on hints and you'll
        soon get stuck. In order to gain more hints, you'll have to start discarding cards.
        <br />
        <span className="txt-blue db mt1">Convention: right-most discard</span>
        Discarding a card can be risky since you could accidently throw away an important card and get stuck in the
        game. Always discard your right-most card as it's the oldest one. Like so, if it was dangerous to discard, your
        teammates would have had time to let you know.

        Looks like your teammates are a bit wasteful. You're out of hints. They'll probably have to discard next turn.
        <br />
        It's okay though. Jane will discard her second {card(IColor.YELLOW, 3)} and Adam will discard{" "}
        {card(IColor.GREEN, 4)}. They're not needed right now and there is another similar card available somewhere in
        the deck.

        Things are getting dangerous. You're still low on hints and Adam might discard {card(IColor.GREEN, 5)} next
        turn. There's only one {vignette("number", 5)} for each color in the deck so it should never be discarded!
        <br />
        <span className="txt-blue db mt1">Convention: danger hint</span>
        When giving / receiving a hint on a card you might discard next turn, let's assume it's too risky to discard.
        Instead, discard the one at its left.
